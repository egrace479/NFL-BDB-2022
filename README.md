# NFL-BDB-2022

This repository is for Elizabeth G. Campolongo, Ranthony A.C. Edmonds, and Chaya Norton's Erd√∂s Data Science Project in Fall 2021. 

This project will be completed as a submission to the NFL Big Data Bowl 2022, listed on Kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/overview.

Additionally, this project was suggested by MinedXAI, with the goal to leverage Topological Data Analysis (TDA) as a tool to better understand NFL Special Teams Plays. 

Our NFL data was compiled by the hosts of the competition, and the Weather data is from Thomas Bliss (ThompsonJamesBliss on GitHub), one of the competition hosts.
